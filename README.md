New York City is Airbnbâ€™s largest domestic market, with more than 50,000 apartment rental listings. But under state law, it is illegal in most buildings for an apartment to be rented out for less than 30 days unless the permanent tenant is residing in the apartment at the same time. Over the past decade there have been many altercations between AirBnb and the state for the same reason.

The objective of the project is to visualize data present in the [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) and analyze listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

Uploaded in the repository, is a packaged workbook of the data and the analysis. The same can be found on y Tableau Public Profile [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/namita.ramesh#!/vizhome/AirBnB-NYC_15800606051900/AirBnBNYC) as well.
